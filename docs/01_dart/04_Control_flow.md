# Control flow statements

Dart has no surprises here. You can use the regular C-like `if-else`, `while`, `do-while`, fixed step `for`, `switch-case` and `try-catch` statements along with `break` and `continue`.  There is also a `for-each` implementation on the collections.

Dart even has the ternary operator `bool_expression ? ifTrue : ifFalse`.
