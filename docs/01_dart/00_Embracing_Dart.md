## Embracing Dart

Much like other modern programming languages (for example [Kotlin](https://try.kotlinlang.org/) or [Swift](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/)), Dart has a free playground which you can use to get familiar with the syntax and special features. It's called DartPad and you can find it at  https://dartpad.dev/ .

Dart also has most of the features you would expect if you're coming from Kotlin, Swift - or even JavaSrcript for that matter -, so if you have a past with those languages, you can catch on quickly.

This Dart overview aims at giving you the basic concepts of the language. It covers most language features used in the [Flutter example projects](../../projects).

For more detailed information and deeper descriptions, please visit the official [tour of the Dart language](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour).
