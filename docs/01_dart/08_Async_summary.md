# Asynchronous programming

The official [Dart language tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#asynchrony-support) gives a great overview and explanation on the workings of the Future API and the `async`-`await` keyword pair. In a nutshell, a `Future` represents a longer, ongoing task that runs asynchronously. A `Future` can complete in one of two ways: it either completes with a value or an error.

The `async`-`await` keyword pair takes some weight off the developers' shoulder when it comes to handling Futures.

# Summary

Now that you're familiar with the basics of what Dart can offer, it's time to dive into Flutter!

If you feel confident enough with Dart and Flutter, you can jump right to the  [Flutter feature demo projects](..\03_common_task_demos\01_Common_task_demos.md) , the [widget state handling section](..\04_state_management\01_app_architecture_and_state_mananagement), or the [complex app project](..\05_complex_project\01_Complex_project.md).
