## Examples for common mobile development tasks

The following small projects demonstrate some common tasks you will most certainly bump into while developing mobile apps, provided you are not a seasoned developer. If you are one, these examples will be all-too-familiar, but they sill worth to take a look.

* [UI](../../projects/01_common_task_demos/01_ui_demo)
* [Navigation](../../projects/01_common_task_demos/02_navigation_demo)
* [Localization](../../projects/01_common_task_demos/03_localization_demo)
* [Image loading](../../projects/01_common_task_demos/04_image_loading_demo)
* [JSON parsing](../../projects/01_common_task_demos/05_json_parsing_demo)
* [Network API call](../../projects/01_common_task_demos/06_network_demo)
* Database handling
  * For an example on high-level database handling in Flutter, see the *database* package in the [complex app example project](./projects/complex_app/so_flutter_questions/lib/database).

From here, you can continue your journey to [state management](../04_state_management/01_app_architecture_and_state_mananagement) or towards the 01_Common_task_demos.md) complex app?
