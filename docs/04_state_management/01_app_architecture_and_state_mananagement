# App architecture and state management [(samples)](https://fluttersamples.com/)

Architecting your app well can be a great challenge by itself, more so on a new platform. This section will guide you through some basic principles of app Flutter app architectures. 

The app you will be working with is a simple, one-screen, home heating controller sporting a basic UI.

It's called Thermostat, and you can find the initial state of the project here: [Thermostat base project](.\projects\state_handling_demos\01_thermostat_base)

There are milestones on the way, so if you ever feel lost or want to skip a portion of this section, you can fast forward to these pages:

* [Ad hoc architecture](02_ad_hoc.md) 
* [Lifting state up](03_lifting_state_up.md) 
* [InheritedWidget](04_InheritedWidget.md) 
* [Manual BLoC](05_Manual_bloc.md) 

Next up is the Ad hoc [Ad hoc architecture](02_ad_hoc.md) demo.
