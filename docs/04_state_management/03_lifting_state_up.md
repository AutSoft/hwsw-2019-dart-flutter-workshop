# Lifting State Up

It's time to refactor the screen to have more restraints on how its state is handled. First of all, wrap the state variables into an immutable [PODO](http://maxhorstmann.net/blog/2013/09/22/plain-old-dart-objects/):

```dart
@immutable
class ThermostatState {
  final int currentTemperature;
  final int targetTemperature;
  final ActionInProgress actionInProgress;

  ThermostatState(
      {this.currentTemperature = 22,
      this.targetTemperature = 22,
      this.actionInProgress = ActionInProgress.IDLE});
}
```

Notice that your replaced the `status` and `actionInProgress` properties with one single `actionInProgress` property of the newly created `ActionInProgress` enum type. This way the model only holds information on what state the heating system is in and you can handle the actual representation of this state in the `MainPage` widget.

> A copy method on the `ThermostatModel `class would be nice to have when you have to update state with an immutable class. As of version 2.6.1 - unlike Kotlin and much like Swift - Dart only allows constant values as default values for method parameters. This leaves only one option: you need to call the fully parameterized constructor even when you want to copy only a part of the state.

Right now, `MainPage` is a `StatefulWidget` that is responsible for taking care of its state and state changes. The goal is to make `MainPage` behave like a simple view, so it should only *receive* the state it has to render. This is the point where *lifting state up* comes into play.

Lifting the state up will take multiple-steps, but it's worth the trouble.

Notice that there's another widget in the project called `ThermostatApp` which represents the application itself. Right now its only responsibility is to set the title and theme of the application and display the `MainPage` widget as the home screen. Make it a `StatefulWidget` and lift the state and the state handling logic up from `MainPage`.

```dart
class ThermostatApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ThermostatAppState createState() => _ThermostatAppState();
}
```

You have to create the class representing the state of the `ThermostatApp` widget. 

```dart
class _ThermostatAppState extends State<ThermostatApp> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Thermostat',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MainPage(title: 'Thermostat'),
    );
  }
}
```

At first, this code will do the exact same thing as before, you just modified `ThermostatApp` to be a working `StatefulWidget`.

Next up, you'll change `MainPage` to be a `StatelessWidget`, which only receives the state it has to render in its constructor, along with some callback functions which were its state's own methods before.

```dart
class MainPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;

  final ThermostatState appState;

  final Function setWarmer;

  final Function setColder;

  MainPage({Key key, this.title, this.appState, this.setWarmer, this.setColder})
      : super(key: key);
    
  // ...
}
```

> As you've seen before, functions are first class citizens in Dart, much like in Kotlin or Swift. The main difference lies within the handling of nullability in Dart. Because any parameter of a function can be null - so as the returned value -,  functions can be represented by *Function* without explicitly declaring the type of the function we're expecting. This seems convenient, but without enough care it can lead to compile time errors.

Move the widget building functions from `_MainPageState` to `MainPage`, including the overridden `build` function:

```dart
class MainPage extends StatelessWidget {
  
  // ...
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text(title),
        ),
        body: _buildBody());
  }

  Widget _buildBody() { /* ... */ }

  Widget _buildControls() { /* ... */ }

  Widget _buildActionIndicator() { /* ... */ }

  Widget _buildTargetTemperature() { /* ... */ }

  Widget _buildCurrentTemperature(ThermostatState appState) { /* ... */ }
```

> Notice that the `AppBar` widget now takes the `title` property of `MainPage` as its title.

You'll do some further refactoring to pass down the state on the widget graph. Let's pass the state to all widget builders as a parameter which need it for displaying their content. These functions are `_buildBody`, `_buildActionIndicator`, `_buildTargetTemperature`, and `_buildCurrentTemperature`. Note that one of the widget builders - `_buildControls` - has no dependency on the state, but it operates with action callbacks which it receives as parameters. For example:

```dart
Widget _buildControls(Function setWarmer, Function setColder) {
  return Padding(
    padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 40),
    child: Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: setColder,
          tooltip: 'Colder',
          child: Icon(Icons.remove),
        ),
        SizedBox(
          width: 40,
        ),
        FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: setWarmer,
          tooltip: 'Warmer',
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}

Widget _buildTargetTemperature(ThermostatState appState) {
  return Padding(
    padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 40),
    child: Text(
      "Target temperature\n${appState.targetTemperature} Â°C",
      textAlign: TextAlign.center,
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),
    ),
  );
}
```

It's time to get rid of the `_MainPageState` class. Move all the remaining logic from `_MainPageState` to `_ThermostatAppState` so it looks like the following code:

```dart
class _ThermostatAppState extends State<ThermostatApp> {
  var state = ThermostatState();

  Timer _worldTimer;

  void _handleWorldTimerEvent(Timer timer) {
    setState(() {
      if (state.currentTemperature > state.targetTemperature) {
        state = ThermostatState(
            currentTemperature: state.currentTemperature - 1,
            targetTemperature: state.targetTemperature,
            actionInProgress: ActionInProgress.COOLING);
      } else if (state.currentTemperature < state.targetTemperature) {
        state = ThermostatState(
            currentTemperature: state.currentTemperature + 1,
            targetTemperature: state.targetTemperature,
            actionInProgress: ActionInProgress.WARMING);
      } else {
        timer.cancel();
        _worldTimer = null;
        state = ThermostatState(
            currentTemperature: state.currentTemperature,
            targetTemperature: state.targetTemperature,
            actionInProgress: ActionInProgress.IDLE);
      }
    });
  }

  void _setWarmer() {
    setState(() {
      if (state.targetTemperature < MAX_TEMP) {
        state = ThermostatState(
            currentTemperature: state.currentTemperature,
            targetTemperature: state.targetTemperature + 1,
            actionInProgress: state.actionInProgress);
        _startWorldTimer();
      }
    });
  }

  void _setColder() {
    setState(() {
      if (state.targetTemperature > MIN_TEMP) {
        state = ThermostatState(
            currentTemperature: state.currentTemperature,
            targetTemperature: state.targetTemperature - 1,
            actionInProgress: state.actionInProgress);
        _startWorldTimer();
      }
    });
  }

  void _cancelWorldTimer() {
    if (_worldTimer != null) {
      _worldTimer.cancel();
      _worldTimer = null;
    }
  }

  void _startWorldTimer() {
    if (_worldTimer == null) {
      _worldTimer =
          Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), _handleWorldTimerEvent);
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Thermostat',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MainPage(
        title: 'Thermostat',
        appState: state,
        setWarmer: _setWarmer,
        setColder: _setColder,
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _cancelWorldTimer();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

Now you can safely delete `_MainPageState`.

All that you did was you moved state handling up one level on the widget tree. We started to move towards a form of separation of concerns. Now the app handles the state and the *screen* is only responsible for displaying it.

If there would be another screen which needed the same - or a bit extended - state we could easily implement said screen essentially the same way as we did with `MainPage`.

[There is a neat trick using `InheritedWidget` to solve this problem.](04_InheritedWidget.md)
